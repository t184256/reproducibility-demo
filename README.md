# A small RPM reproducibility workshop

## Solved exercises

* building an SRPM of hello package, back-to-back reproducibility
* building a binary RPM of hello package, back-to-back reproducibility

## Suggested follow-up exercises

* building an binary RPM of a Python hello package, back-to-back reproducibility
* building an SRPM of hello package matching somebody else's SRPM
* building a binary RPM of hello package matching somebody else's RPM
* experimenting with your own RPM:
    * if you're experimenting during workshop, pick one that builds quickly
    * pick one that ships a static library for maximum fun
